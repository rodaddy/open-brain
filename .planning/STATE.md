## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-project]: Embedding model switched from text-embedding-004 (dead) to gemini-embedding-001 via LiteLLM
- [Pre-project]: LiteLLM proxy already updated -- `embeddings` alias repointed, `text-embedding-004` kept as named fallback
- [Pre-project]: Tech stack confirmed: Bun + Express.js, MCP SDK ^1.27.0, pg + pgvector-node, StreamableHTTPServerTransport, Bearer token auth
- [Phase 01]: createApp takes pool and tokenMap as injected dependencies for testability
- [Phase 01]: Transport map keyed by session ID with onsessioninitialized/onclose lifecycle hooks

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Verify pgvector version on 10.71.20.49 (need >= 0.8.0 for HNSW + halfvec). Upgrade to 0.8.2 if needed.
- [Phase 1]: Check max_connections on shared PostgreSQL instance to confirm connection limit sizing.
