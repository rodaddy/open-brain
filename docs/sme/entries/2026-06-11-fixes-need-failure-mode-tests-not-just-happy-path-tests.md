## [2026-06-11] Fixes need failure-mode tests, not just happy-path tests

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Source:** Issues #77-#82
**Scope:** all Open Brain client/facade work
**Status:** active

### Pattern

The first package swarm had good happy-path coverage, but later reviews found
outage and malformed-input behavior: replay dispatch, live redaction, malformed
DreamEngine reports, unbounded responses, and missing in-process transport
contracts.

### Review Questions

- What fails if the server is slow, down, malformed, oversized, or partially
  successful?
- Does each recovery feature prove durability under its own failure mode?
- Are tests only asserting method names, or are they asserting state after
  failure?
