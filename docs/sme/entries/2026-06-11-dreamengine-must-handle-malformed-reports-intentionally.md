## [2026-06-11] DreamEngine must handle malformed reports intentionally

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Source:** Issues #82, PR #75 review loop
**Scope:** `python/openbrain-memory/src/openbrain_memory/dream.py`
**Status:** active

### Pattern

DreamEngine dry-run planning can be correct for happy-path reports while
behaving poorly on malformed or mixed valid/invalid server candidates.

### Review Questions

- Does malformed server output fail closed or skip invalid candidates with
  diagnostics?
- Is mixed valid/invalid candidate behavior locked by tests?
- Are namespace-scoped dreams prevented from planning global tier actions?
- Are limits bounded to the strictest downstream MCP tool schema?

### Prior Fix

PR #75 made `dream_once()` dry-run-only, bounded limits to 100, suppressed
unscoped tier actions for namespace dreams, and rejected boolean numeric config.
